<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Pyrometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reflective Type</li><li>Refraction Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation pyrometers are precision instruments used for temperature measurement based on infrared radiation emitted by objects. The market is segmented into two main types: reflective and refraction pyrometers. Reflective pyrometers measure temperature by detecting infrared radiation reflected from a surface, making them suitable for shiny or metallic materials. Refraction pyrometers, on the other hand, utilize the bending of infrared rays through optical elements, enabling high accuracy for non-reflective or transparent surfaces. Both types are vital in various industrial applications.</p></p>
