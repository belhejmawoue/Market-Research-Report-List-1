<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polypropylene Fume Hood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Hood</li><li>Ducted Fume Hood</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The polypropylene fume hood market can be categorized into two main types: ductless and ducted fume hoods. Ductless fume hoods are self-contained systems that filter hazardous fumes and recirculate clean air back into the laboratory, making them suitable for spaces without external ventilation. Ducted fume hoods, on the other hand, are connected to an external ventilation system, effectively exhausting harmful fumes outside. Both types are designed to ensure user safety in laboratories by minimizing exposure to toxic substances.</p></p>
